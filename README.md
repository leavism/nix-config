# Nix Config for macOS and NixOS
This was originally generated from [dustinlyons/nixos-config](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config), which is arguably *the best* nix configuration template available. However, I've changed my nix configs so much it doesn't even resemble the original by dustinlyons anymore.

## Layout
```
nixos-config/
├── apps      # Nix commands to bootstrap and build configurations
├── home      # MacOS/nix-darwin, NixOS, and shared configurations
├── hosts     # Host-specific configuration
├── overlays  # Drop an overlay file in this dir, and it runs.
```
## Work in progress
> [!CAUTION]
> The installation and setup instructions are WIP as they are a copy of the instructions from [dustinlyons/nixos-config](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config).
>
> For now (December 2024) they do not reflect the changes I've made and may not work properly.
> Here's what still needs to be done to better document the set up process:
> - [ ] Provide instructions on changing device hostname before running `apps/` commands.
> - [ ] Provide instructions on how to add a new user into the configurations.
>   - [ ] Maybe rewrite the `.#apply` command entirely.
> - [ ] Provide instructions on how to add a new hostname/device into the configurations.
> - [ ] Provide documentations on how the home-manager is set up.
> - [ ] Provide documentation on how packages are declared.
> - [ ] Put in my dot file configurations (maybe?). I wouldn't mind continuing to use chezmoi to manage my dot files.
> - [ ] Check if this works on a NixOS host.

## Installation and Setup
## For macOS
### 1. Install dependencies
```sh
xcode-select --install
```

### 2. Install Nix
Thank you for the [installer](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-installer), [Determinate Systems](https://determinate.systems/)!
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```
After installation, open a new terminal session to make the `nix` executable available in your `$PATH`. You'll need this in the steps ahead.
### 3. Clone this repo into your home directory
```sh
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/leavism/nix-config.git
```
and then `cd` into the project directory.
```sh
cd nixos-config
```
### 4. Make `apps` commands executable
Make sure you're running this inside the project directory as it will not provide any feedback on failure nor success.
```sh
find apps/$(uname -m | sed 's/arm64/aarch64/')-darwin -type f \( -name apply -o -name build -o -name build-switch -o -name create-keys -o -name copy-keys -o -name check-keys \) -exec chmod +x {} \;
```
> [!WARNING]
> The steps beyond here are subject to change in the near future and may not work on all systems. Refer to the [WIP message](#work-in-progress) for more details.
### 5. Apply your current user info
Run this Nix command to replace stub values with your system properties, username, full name, and email.
> Your email is only used in the `git` configuration.
```sh
nix run .#apply
```
> [!NOTE]
> If this command doesn't work, then step 4 wasn't done correctly as this is one of the `apps/` commands that needs to be executable.

### 6. Build your configurations
Ensure nix will build your configuration before deploying your configurations with this command.
```sh
nix run .#build
```

### 7. Apply changes
To apply your configurations to your system, run:
```sh
nix run .#build-switch
```
